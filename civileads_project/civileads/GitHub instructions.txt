Let's convert your CiviLeads work into a proper project, step by step:
Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

Open your web browser and go to GitHub

Go to https://github.com and log in (or create an account if needed)


Create a new repository

Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
Repository name: "CiviLeads"
Description: "Tool for finding municipal officials and tracking project opportunities"
Make it Public or Private (your choice)
Check "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository"



Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Computer

Get the repository URL

On your new GitHub repository page, click the green "Code" button
Copy the HTTPS URL (it should look like https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CiviLeads.git)


Clone the repository using Git

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell on your computer
Navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., cd Documents)
Run: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CiviLeads.git
This will create a new CiviLeads folder with the Git repository



Step 3: Set Up the Project Structure

Create the basic project structure

Navigate into the cloned folder: cd CiviLeads
Create the following folders:
Copymkdir civileads
mkdir scripts
mkdir tests
mkdir data



Create necessary files

In the civileads folder, create an __init__.py file:

Open VSCode: code civileads/__init__.py
Add the line: """CiviLeads package for municipal data collection."""
Save the file





Step 4: Copy Your Existing Code

Copy your working files into the project structure

Copy config.py to civileads/config.py
Copy database.py to civileads/database.py
Copy scraper.py to civileads/scraper.py
Create a new run.py in scripts/run.py based on your main.py


Create a requirements.txt file

In the root directory, create requirements.txt:
Copyrequests>=2.28.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0
pandas>=1.5.0
openpyxl>=3.0.10




Step 5: Update the README.md

Edit the README.md file with project information

Open: code README.md
Replace contents with:



markdownCopy# CiviLeads

A tool for finding municipal officials and tracking project opportunities.

Step 6: Create a run.py Script

Create the run.py file

Open: code scripts/run.py
Add this content:



pythonCopy#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
CiviLeads main execution script.

Step 7: Update the Imports in Your Code Files

Update your config.py file

Ensure paths are relative to the package structure
Update imports if needed


Update your database.py file

Update the import from from config import DATABASE_PATH to from civileads.config import DATABASE_PATH


Update your scraper.py file

Update the import from from config import HEADERS to from civileads.config import HEADERS



Step 8: Add a .gitignore File

Create a .gitignore file

Open: code .gitignore
Add:



Copy# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/

*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite3

# Data files

!data/.gitkeep

# Excel files

# Logs
*.log

# Local env settings
.env
.venv
env/
venv/
ENV/

# IDE settings
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

Create a .gitkeep file in the data directory

Run: type nul > data/.gitkeep (Windows) or touch data/.gitkeep (Mac/Linux)



Step 9: Commit and Push Your Project

Add all files to Git

Run: git add .


Commit the changes

Run: git commit -m "Initial project setup with code structure"


Push to GitHub

Run: git push origin main



Step 10: Set Up a Project Board on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository page
Click on the "Projects" tab
Click "Create a project"
Select "Board" template
Name it "CiviLeads Development"
Add columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Testing", "Done"
Add cards for your next steps:

Improve municipality search accuracy
Add project opportunity tracking
Implement vendor history analysis
Develop simple GUI interface

PS C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents\CiviLeads>EditI see you're trying to use Git, but it's not installed on your system. Let's modify our approach:
Alternative to Step 2: Set Up Project Without Git
Since Git isn't installed, we'll create the project structure manually:

Create a new project folder

Create a new folder named "CiviLeads_Project" somewhere convenient
This will be your clean, organized project folder


Set up the project structure

Inside the CiviLeads_Project folder, create these folders:

civileads
scripts
tests
data




Create the necessary files

In the civileads folder, create a blank file named __init__.py
In the root folder, create a file named README.md
In the root folder, create a file named requirements.txt



Once you've created this structure, we can proceed with copying your existing code into the new organized structure.
Would you like to proceed with this approach, or would you prefer to install Git first? Git would give you version control benefits, but it's not strictly necessary to organize your project.RetryMis it easier to just install git?EditYes, installing Git would be easier in the long run and provides many benefits:

Version control for your code
Easy backups to GitHub or other platforms
Ability to collaborate with others
Tracking changes over time
Option to revert to previous versions if needed

Here's how to install Git:

Download Git for Windows

Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
The download should start automatically
Run the downloaded installer


Install Git

Accept the license agreement
Choose the installation location (default is fine)
Select components (default options are good for most users)
Choose the default editor (Notepad or VSCode if you have it)
Choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
Choose "Use the OpenSSL library" for HTTPS
Choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"
Choose "Use Windows' default console window"
Keep default extra options
Click Install


Verify installation

After installation completes, open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window
Type git --version and press Enter
If Git is installed correctly, you'll see the version number



Once Git is installed, you can continue with Step 2.2 from the previous instructions to clone your repository.

    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
PS C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents\CiviLeads>EditI see that Git is still not recognized even though you tried to install it. This could be because:

The installation didn't complete successfully
The system PATH wasn't updated to include Git
You might need to restart your PowerShell/Command Prompt or even your computer

Let's try an alternative approach and proceed without Git for now. We can still organize your project effectively:
Let's Set Up Your Project Manually

Create your project structure

Create a new folder named "CiviLeads_Project" in a location of your choice
Inside this folder, create the following subfolders:

civileads
scripts
tests
data




Copy your existing files

Copy config.py into the civileads folder
Copy database.py into the civileads folder
Copy scraper.py into the civileads folder
Create a new file in the civileads folder named __init__.py (empty file is fine)


Create a run.py file

Create a new file in the scripts folder named run.py
We'll add code to this file in the next step


Create a README.md file

Create a new file in the main project folder named README.md
We'll add content to this file in a later step



This gives you a clean, organized project structure without requiring Git. Later, if you want to use version control, you can either try installing Git again or use another method like simply creating backup copies of your project at important milestones.
Let me know when you have this structure set up, and we'll proceed with updating the files.
